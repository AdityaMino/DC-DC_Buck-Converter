# DC-DC_Buck-Converter
The name “Buck Converter” presumably evolves from the fact that the input voltage is bucked/chopped or attenuated, in amplitude and a lower amplitude voltage appears at the output. An external diode, together with an external inductor and output capacitor, produces the regulated DC output.
